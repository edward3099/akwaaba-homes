## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Frontend Technologies:**
- **Next.js 15** - Modern React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **ShadCN UI** - Professional component library
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach

### **Backend Technologies:**
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service platform
- **PostgreSQL** - Reliable database system
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Database-level security
- **Edge Functions** - Serverless backend functions
- **Real-time Subscriptions** - Live data updates

### **Architecture:**
- **Server-Side Rendering** - Next.js Server Components
- **API Routes** - RESTful API endpoints
- **Middleware** - Authentication and route protection
- **Database Schema** - Proper relationships and constraints

---

## 🐛 **CRITICAL BUGS RESOLVED**

### **1. Authentication Bug - RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: Login API was looking up profiles by `id` instead of `user_id`
- **Root Cause**: Database schema has separate `id` (profile primary key) and `user_id` (auth user reference)
- **Solution**: Updated login API to use `user_id` for profile lookup
- **Result**: Admin users now correctly return `user_role: 'admin'`

### **2. Admin Route Protection - IMPLEMENTED**
- **Issue**: Admin routes were accessible without authentication
- **Solution**: Created `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` with server-side authentication
- **Result**: All admin routes now properly redirect unauthenticated users to login

### **3. Login Page Updates - COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: Login page was checking for `user_type` instead of `user_role`
- **Solution**: Updated login page to use correct field and redirect admins to `/admin`
- **Result**: Admin users are now properly redirected after login
