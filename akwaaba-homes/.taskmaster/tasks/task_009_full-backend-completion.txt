# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing and QA Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish a robust testing framework for the entire application. This includes implementing unit, integration, API, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and validate all backend and frontend functionality.
# Details:
Begin by using Context7 to research testing best practices for full-stack Next.js applications. Implement a multi-layered testing approach: 1. **Unit Tests:** Use Jest and React Testing Library to test individual React components, hooks, and utility functions in isolation. 2. **Integration Tests:** Write tests that verify interactions between multiple components, such as form submissions and data fetching flows. 3. **API Tests:** Create a test suite using Jest and Supertest to directly test all Next.js API routes. These tests will validate request handling, business logic, database interactions, and response formats for all CRUD operations. 4. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Use Cypress or Playwright to script and automate key user journeys, such as user registration, agent application, property creation, and advanced search. 5. **CI/CD Integration:** Configure a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically run the entire test suite on every pull request. Set up test coverage reporting to monitor and enforce code quality standards.

# Test Strategy:
Verification will be done by confirming the testing infrastructure is fully operational. 1. Run `npm test` and ensure all unit, integration, and API tests execute successfully. 2. Introduce a deliberate bug into a component and confirm the relevant unit test fails. 3. Execute the E2E test suite (`npx cypress run`) and verify that all critical user flow simulations pass. 4. Generate a code coverage report and confirm it meets the project's target percentage (e.g., >80%). 5. Create a pull request and verify that the CI pipeline is triggered, runs all tests, and reports a 'success' status on GitHub.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup and Configure Testing Frameworks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure all necessary testing libraries and frameworks. This includes setting up Jest with React Testing Library for frontend tests, Supertest for API tests, and Cypress for end-to-end tests. Create base configuration files, helper functions, and mock setups.
### Details:
Install Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest, and Cypress. Configure `jest.config.js` and `cypress.config.js`. Set up environment variables for testing. Create mock service workers or mock data providers for isolating tests.

## 2. Develop Frontend Unit and Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Write unit tests for individual React components, hooks, and utilities using Jest and React Testing Library. Also, create integration tests that verify interactions between multiple components, such as form submissions and data fetching flows.
### Details:
Target key components like buttons, inputs, and display cards for unit tests. Test custom hooks for state management. For integration tests, focus on the property creation form flow, advanced search filtering, and user authentication flows.

## 3. Build Comprehensive API Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a complete test suite for all Next.js API routes using Jest and Supertest. These tests will bypass the UI to directly validate backend logic, database interactions, authentication/authorization, and response formats for all CRUD operations.
### Details:
Write tests for all CRUD operations on properties, user management endpoints, and agent application routes. Validate error handling, status codes, and response schemas. Ensure Row Level Security policies are respected by testing with different user roles.

## 4. Script End-to-End (E2E) Tests for Critical User Journeys [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Use Cypress to write and automate end-to-end tests that simulate real user workflows. These tests will cover critical paths such as user registration, property creation, and the advanced search functionality.
### Details:
Script the full user registration and login flow. Automate the agent application and approval process. Create a test for a user searching for a property using multiple filters, viewing its details, and contacting the agent. Script the entire lifecycle of a property: creation, update, and deletion by an agent.

## 5. Integrate Test Suites into CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Configure a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically run the entire test suite (unit, integration, API) on every pull request. This ensures that new changes do not introduce regressions.
### Details:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Define jobs to install dependencies, build the application, and run the Jest/Supertest test suites. Configure the workflow to block merging of pull requests if any tests fail.

## 6. Add E2E Tests and Coverage Reporting to CI/CD [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Extend the CI/CD pipeline to include the execution of the Cypress E2E test suite. Additionally, set up and configure test coverage reporting to monitor and enforce code quality standards over time.
### Details:
Add a new job to the GitHub Actions workflow for running Cypress tests. Integrate a service like Codecov or Coveralls to process and report on test coverage data generated by Jest. Set a coverage threshold that must be met for pull requests to be merged.
