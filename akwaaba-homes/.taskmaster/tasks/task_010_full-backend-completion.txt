# Task ID: 10
# Title: Production Deployment and Comprehensive Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish the production deployment pipeline, create comprehensive documentation for APIs and maintenance, and configure the live environment with monitoring and backup strategies.
# Details:
Begin by using Context7 to research best practices for production deployment of Next.js/Supabase applications. First, create comprehensive documentation: 1) Generate OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications for all backend API endpoints. 2) Write a detailed deployment guide covering environment setup, build processes, and Supabase configuration. 3) Create a maintenance manual outlining procedures for database backups, log analysis, and dependency updates. Next, provision the production environment using Supabase MCP, configuring separate production secrets and environment variables. Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) that automatically runs the test suite from Task 9 and deploys the application to production on successful builds. Configure production-grade logging, set up uptime monitoring with alerts, and schedule regular automated database backups within the Supabase dashboard. Finally, document the backup restoration process.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Documentation Review:** Have a team member follow the deployment guide to set up a staging environment from scratch; the process should be successful without further assistance. Review API and maintenance docs for clarity and completeness. 2. **Deployment Verification:** Confirm the CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys the main branch to the production URL. Perform a smoke test on the live application, verifying user registration, login, property search, and admin panel access. 3. **Monitoring & Backup Validation:** Check the configured logging service to ensure live traffic is being recorded. Trigger a test alert from the uptime monitor to confirm notifications are working. Manually initiate a database backup from the Supabase dashboard, download the file, and verify its integrity by restoring it to a new, temporary Supabase project.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Provision and Configure Production Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provision the production Supabase project and hosting environment. Configure all necessary environment variables, secrets, and access controls for the live application.
### Details:
Use Supabase MCP to create a new production project. Configure production secrets using Supabase Vault. Set up environment variables in the chosen hosting provider (e.g., Vercel) for the Next.js application. Ensure database access policies are hardened for production.

## 2. Implement CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build and configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment. The pipeline should deploy to the production environment upon successful test completion on the main branch.
### Details:
The workflow must first run the complete test suite defined in Task 9. On success, it will trigger a production build of the Next.js application and deploy it. Use GitHub secrets to manage Supabase and hosting provider access tokens securely.

## 3. Set Up Production Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Integrate production-grade logging and set up external uptime monitoring with automated alerting to ensure platform stability and rapid incident response.
### Details:
Configure the application to send structured logs to a centralized service (e.g., Supabase Logs, Datadog). Set up an external service like UptimeRobot to ping critical application endpoints and trigger alerts via email or Slack on failure or high latency.

## 4. Establish Automated Database Backup Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Configure and enable automated daily backups and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for the production Supabase database to prevent data loss.
### Details:
Within the Supabase dashboard for the production project, enable the PITR feature and configure the schedule for daily full backups. Confirm the backup retention policy meets project requirements.

## 5. Create API and Operations Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Generate OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications for all backend API endpoints and write a detailed deployment guide and maintenance manual for ongoing operations.
### Details:
Use a tool to generate OpenAPI specs from code. The deployment guide should cover the CI/CD process. The maintenance manual should outline procedures for log analysis, dependency updates, and troubleshooting based on the configured environment.

## 6. Document and Test Backup Restoration Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Document the step-by-step process for restoring the database from a backup and conduct a dry run to validate the procedure and ensure data integrity.
### Details:
Create a detailed guide on how to perform a database restore using the Supabase dashboard. Execute a test restore to a new, temporary Supabase project. Verify the restored data's integrity and application functionality against the restored database. This process must not affect the live production environment.
