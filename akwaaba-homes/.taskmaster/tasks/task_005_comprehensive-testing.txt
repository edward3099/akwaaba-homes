# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Page Object Model (POM) Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Scaffold the directory structure and create base classes for the Page Object Model to ensure maintainable and reusable test code.
# Details:
Create a `tests/pages` directory. Inside, create files for each major page or component, e.g., `homePage.ts`, `loginPage.ts`, `propertyDetailsPage.ts`. Each class will encapsulate the selectors and methods for interacting with that page. For example, `loginPage.ts` will have methods like `login(username, password)`.

# Test Strategy:
Create a simple test that imports and uses a method from a Page Object class (e.g., `homePage.goto()`). The test should pass, demonstrating that the structure is correctly implemented.
