Performance Optimization Testing (Task 12 Validation)\n2. Core User Experience Testing\n3. Responsive Design & Cross-Browser Testing\n4. Performance & Load Testing\n5. Security & Authentication Testing\n6. Integration & API Testing\n\n**BrowserMCP Testing Approach**:\n- Real user interaction simulation\n- Performance metrics validation\n- Cross-browser compatibility testing\n- Responsive design validation\n- Security and authentication testing\n- API integration validation\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- Page Load Time: < 3 seconds for all pages\n- API Response Time: < 500ms for all API calls\n- Image Loading: < 2 seconds for optimized images\n- Cache Hit Rate: > 80% for repeated requests\n- Navigation Success Rate: 100% for all user flows\n\n**Next Steps**: Execute comprehensive testing using BrowserMCP to validate all implemented features before proceeding with documentation and deployment.",
