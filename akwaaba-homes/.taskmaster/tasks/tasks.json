Supabase Client Initialization Issue: The main supabase.ts client is using @supabase/supabase-js but the middleware and auth context are using @supabase/ssr - this creates inconsistency\n2. Session Management: The auth context is creating a new browser client on every render instead of using a singleton pattern\n3. Route Protection Mismatch: Middleware protects /admin but the Dashboard component redirects to /agent/dashboard for agents\n\nMissing Routes:\n1. Dashboard Route: /dashboard exists but redirects users to role-specific routes\n2. Property Creation Route: /properties/create doesn't exist - needs to be created\n3. Admin Dashboard Route: /admin route exists but has authentication issues\n\nReact Infinite Loop in Signup Form:\n1. PasswordStrengthMeter Component: The useEffect in PasswordStrengthMeter calls onStrengthChange on every password change, which triggers a re-render in the parent\n2. State Update Chain: Parent component updates state → triggers PasswordStrengthMeter re-render → calls onStrengthChange → parent updates state again → infinite loop\n\nSession Management Issues:\n1. Multiple Supabase Clients: Different parts of the app use different Supabase client initialization methods\n2. Auth State Synchronization: The auth context and middleware are not properly synchronized\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Fix Supabase client initialization to use consistent approach\n2. Fix the infinite loop in PasswordStrengthMeter\n3. Create missing property creation route\n4. Fix authentication flow and session management\n5.

Supabase Client Consistency: Fixed src/lib/supabase.ts to use @supabase/ssr consistently with the rest of the app and updated from createClient to createBrowserClient for SSR compatibility.\n2. React Infinite Loop Fixed: Fixed the PasswordStrengthMeter component infinite loop by adding useCallback for the onStrengthChange callback, optimizing useEffect dependencies, adding state comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and preventing infinite state update cycles.\n3. Authentication Context Fixed: Updated the useEnhancedAuth hook to use a singleton Supabase client, removed the creation of a new browser client on every render, fixed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks, and improved session management consistency.\n4. Missing Routes Created: Created the /properties/create route with a full form, the /agent/dashboard route, and API endpoints for properties, agent stats, and admin stats.\n5. Dashboard Components Fixed: Fixed the Dashboard component to properly redirect to role-specific routes, created the AgentDashboardPage component, fixed the AdminDashboardLayout component, and created the missing AdminOverview component.\n\nCurrent Status:\nAll major authentication and routing issues are resolved. React infinite loops have been eliminated. Missing routes, components, and API endpoints for data operations have been implemented.\n\nNext Steps:\n1.

Create a simple test route, such as `/api/health`, that returns a basic JSON response to isolate the routing problem from other application logic. Review `next.config.js` for any custom configurations like rewrites or redirects that might be interfering. 2. **Fix Supabase Client in API Routes:** The 500 error on `/api/properties` strongly suggests an issue with server-side Supabase client initialization, similar to the issue addressed in Task #3. Ensure that all API routes are using the correct helper from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`, such as `createRouteHandlerClient`, and that cookies are being passed correctly to authenticate the request. Verify that all necessary Supabase environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) are correctly loaded into the server-side environment. 3. **Resolve Properties API Logic:** Once the client is authenticated, review the logic within the `/api/properties` endpoint. Check the database query for correctness and ensure the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `properties` table allow access for the authenticated user role. Add robust error logging to capture the specific error returned from Supabase. 4. **Verify Homepage Data Fetching:** Confirm the client-side code on the homepage correctly calls the `/api/properties` endpoint and processes the returned data to render the property list.",
