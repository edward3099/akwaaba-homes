# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Platform-Wide Security and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures and performance optimizations across the application. This includes rate limiting, input validation, protection against common vulnerabilities, query optimization, and caching strategies to ensure a secure, fast, and reliable platform.
# Details:
Begin by using Context7 to research security best practices for Next.js/Supabase applications, focusing on the OWASP Top 10. Implement API rate limiting on critical endpoints like login and form submissions. Enforce strict server-side input validation on all API routes using a library like Zod. Review all custom database functions to ensure they are not vulnerable to SQL injection, and verify Row Level Security policies are comprehensive. Sanitize all user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks. Configure Supabase API CORS to only allow requests from the production domain. For performance, use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify and optimize slow database queries, adding indexes where necessary, especially for search and filtering. Implement a multi-layered caching strategy using Next.js's Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for property pages and data caching for frequently accessed API results. Utilize the Supabase Mission Control Panel (MCP) to monitor security and performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Security will be verified by running an automated scanner like OWASP ZAP against the application. Test rate limiting by scripting a burst of requests to a protected endpoint and confirming a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Verify input validation by submitting forms with malicious payloads (e.g., `<script>` tags, SQL fragments) and ensuring they are rejected. Performance will be tested using a tool like k6 to load test key API endpoints, measuring response times under pressure. Validate query optimization by comparing `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` outputs before and after adding indexes. Confirm caching is effective by checking response headers and observing reduced load times on subsequent requests using browser developer tools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement API Rate Limiting on Critical Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to protect critical API endpoints from abuse, such as brute-force attacks on login or resource-intensive form submissions.
### Details:
Use a library like `upstash/ratelimit` or a custom middleware solution to track requests per IP or user. Apply strict limits to endpoints like `/api/auth/login`, `/api/contact`, and any other public-facing forms. Ensure appropriate HTTP 429 responses are sent when the limit is exceeded.

## 2. Enforce Strict Server-Side Input Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive server-side validation for all data received through API routes to ensure data integrity and prevent injection attacks.
### Details:
Utilize a schema validation library like Zod across all API endpoints that accept user input. Define strict schemas for request bodies, query parameters, and route parameters. Ensure that any data failing validation is rejected with a clear 400 Bad Request error message.

## 3. Conduct Security Review and Harden Against Common Vulnerabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Perform a comprehensive security audit and implement measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities as outlined by OWASP, specifically focusing on SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
### Details:
Review all custom Supabase database functions and queries to ensure they are parameterized and not vulnerable to SQLi. Verify that Row Level Security (RLS) policies are correctly and comprehensively applied. Implement a content sanitization process for all user-generated content before it is rendered in the frontend to prevent XSS. Configure Supabase API CORS to strictly allow requests only from the production domain.

## 4. Profile and Optimize Database Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and optimize slow-performing database queries to improve application responsiveness and reduce server load, particularly for search and filtering.
### Details:
Use PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command on queries generated by Supabase, particularly for complex operations like the advanced search and filtering system. Analyze the query plans to identify bottlenecks, such as full table scans. Add appropriate indexes to tables on frequently queried columns (e.g., foreign keys, columns used in `WHERE` clauses for filtering, and text search columns).

## 5. Implement Multi-Layer Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Develop and implement a caching strategy at multiple levels of the application stack to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
### Details:
For static or rarely changing content like individual property detail pages, implement Next.js's Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with a reasonable revalidation period. For dynamic API data that is frequently requested, implement a data caching layer using a solution like Redis or Next.js's built-in data caching features to reduce direct hits to the Supabase database.
