# Task ID: 6
# Title: E2E Test: Unauthenticated Property Search and Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Write Playwright tests to validate the property search and filtering functionality for users who are not logged in.
# Details:
Using the POM structure, create a test file `tests/unauthenticated/search.spec.ts`. The test should navigate to the home page, enter a location into the search bar, apply filters (e.g., price range, number of bedrooms), and assert that the displayed results match the filter criteria.

# Test Strategy:
Run the test suite. It should pass by correctly identifying the number of search results and verifying that key details on the result cards match the applied filters.
