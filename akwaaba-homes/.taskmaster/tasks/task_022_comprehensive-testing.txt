# Task ID: 22
# Title: Verify Cross-Browser Compatibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Execute the full test suite across all target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari/Webkit) to ensure consistent functionality.
# Details:
Run the entire test suite by executing `npx playwright test`. The configuration file should already be set up to run against `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit`. Analyze the test report for any browser-specific failures. These often relate to subtle differences in CSS rendering or JavaScript engine behavior.

# Test Strategy:
The test suite passes with a 100% success rate across all three major browser engines. The HTML report should clearly show the results for each browser project.
