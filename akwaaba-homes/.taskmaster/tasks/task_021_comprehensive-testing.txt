# Task ID: 21
# Title: Validate Responsive Design on Mobile
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Run the core E2E test suite against mobile viewport configurations to validate responsive design and touch interactions.
# Details:
Execute the existing test suites using the mobile projects defined in the Playwright config: `npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"`. Identify and fix any tests that fail due to layout changes (e.g., elements being hidden behind a hamburger menu). Add mobile-specific assertions where necessary, such as checking for the visibility of a mobile-only navigation bar.

# Test Strategy:
A significant portion of the test suite (e.g., >80%) should pass on the mobile emulation projects without modification. The test report should confirm execution on the specified mobile device viewports.
