# Task ID: 15
# Title: Supabase Edge Function Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement tests for Supabase Edge Functions to validate their logic and integration.
# Details:
For each Edge Function, create a corresponding test file. Use a library like `undici` or `node-fetch` to make HTTP requests to the locally running function endpoint (provided by `supabase start`). Test success cases with valid payloads and JWTs, as well as failure cases with invalid data, and assert the correctness of the HTTP response status and body.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the Edge Function returns the expected status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized) and response payloads for a variety of inputs.
