		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Setup and Migration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Database Schema Setup and Migration' task into subtasks. Create separate subtasks for designing the schema, creating migration files for each logical group of tables (e.g., user-related, property-related), implementing Row Level Security policies for each user role (public, authenticated, agent, admin), and creating a seed script for test data.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity comes from the combination of data modeling, SQL migration management, and the intricate logic of multi-role Row Level Security. A mistake here has cascading effects. Breaking it down by table groups and RLS policies makes it manageable and reduces risk."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Authentication System Enhancement",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Authentication System Enhancement' task. Create subtasks for implementing the email verification flow, integrating client and server-side password strength validation, configuring secure session and JWT management, and building the UI/UX for all authentication forms with comprehensive error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct security features. Each feature (email verification, password strength, session management) requires both frontend and backend work and can be developed and tested independently, making it suitable for parallel work streams."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Property Management System with CRUD Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Property Management System' task. Create subtasks for each CRUD operation: building the 'Create Property' form and API, developing the 'Read' property list with server-side pagination and filtering, creating the 'Update Property' form and API, and implementing the soft-delete logic. Add separate subtasks for the multi-image uploader component and the agent assignment feature.",
			"reasoning": "This is a large, core feature with many distinct user-facing functionalities (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search, Filter). Each part of CRUD, plus the advanced features, represents a significant chunk of work that should be tracked and managed separately."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Agent Management and Verification System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Agent Management and Verification System' task. Create subtasks for building the agent application form, developing the admin verification dashboard with approve/reject logic, implementing the Supabase Edge Function for role updates, creating the agent-facing profile management page, and building the basic performance/listings dashboard for agents.",
			"reasoning": "The task describes a clear, multi-step workflow involving different user roles and system components (frontend forms, admin UI, serverless function). Each step in this workflow can be a distinct subtask, allowing for clear progress tracking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Admin Dashboard and Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Admin Dashboard' task into its core modules. Create separate subtasks for implementing the main admin layout with role-based access control, the User Management CRUD interface, the Agent Management/Verification interface, the global Property Management view, the Analytics/Metrics display, and the System Configuration page.",
			"reasoning": "The task is naturally modular, as described in the details (User Management, Agent Management, etc.). Each module is a self-contained feature within the admin dashboard and is a perfect candidate for a subtask, allowing for easier assignment and development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "File Storage and Image Management System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'File Storage and Image Management' task. Create subtasks for configuring Supabase Storage buckets and security policies, developing the Edge Function for on-the-fly image optimization, building a reusable frontend file upload component, and integrating this component into both the property and profile management forms.",
			"reasoning": "The task has distinct parts: backend setup (storage), serverless processing (edge function), frontend component creation, and integration into existing features. This logical separation makes it easy to break down and assign to developers with different specializations (backend vs. frontend)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Search and Filtering System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Advanced Search and Filtering System' task. Create subtasks for the backend database setup including PostgreSQL extensions and triggers, development of the core RPC search function, building the frontend filter UI, integrating a map for geolocation search, and implementing the 'Saved Searches' functionality for users.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most technically challenging tasks, involving advanced database work (PostGIS, FTS) and a complex frontend UI. Each major feature (full-text search, geolocation, saved searches) is a substantial piece of work requiring specialized skills and should be managed as a separate subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Platform-Wide Security and Performance Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Security and Performance Optimization' task. Create subtasks for implementing API rate limiting, enforcing server-side input validation across all endpoints, conducting a security review and hardening against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi), profiling and optimizing database queries with indexes, and implementing a multi-layer caching strategy.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers several distinct domains of non-functional requirements. Each domain (rate limiting, validation, query optimization, caching) is a cross-cutting concern that can be addressed as a separate, focused effort across the codebase, making it ideal for subtask decomposition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing and QA Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Comprehensive Testing and QA Suite' task. Create subtasks for setting up the testing frameworks, writing unit and integration tests for the frontend, developing a complete API test suite, scripting end-to-end tests for critical user journeys, and configuring the CI/CD pipeline to automate the execution of all tests.",
			"reasoning": "The task explicitly calls for a multi-layered testing approach. Each layer (unit, integration, API, E2E) represents a different methodology and toolset, making them ideal candidates for separate subtasks, with an additional subtask for automating the entire process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Production Deployment and Comprehensive Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Production Deployment and Documentation' task. Create subtasks for writing the API and maintenance documentation, provisioning and configuring the production environment, building the CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments, setting up production monitoring and alerting, and establishing and testing the database backup and recovery plan.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines three distinct areas: documentation, deployment automation (DevOps), and production operations (monitoring/backups). Each of these areas is a critical and separable piece of work required to take the application live and warrants its own subtask for clarity and accountability."
