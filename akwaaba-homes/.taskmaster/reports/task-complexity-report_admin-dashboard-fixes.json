		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Client Component Prop Passing Errors",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task down into three subtasks: one for applying the 'use client' directive to the verifications page component, a second for applying it to the properties approvals page component, and a third for running the specified tests to verify both fixes.",
			"reasoning": "The fix is simple and well-defined, involving adding 'use client' to two parent components. The complexity is low as it's a known pattern for a specific Next.js error. Subtasks can track the fix for each page separately and the final testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Resolve Redux State Destructuring Error on Analytics Page",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create three subtasks for this issue: 1. Investigate the Redux store configuration, analytics slice reducer, and component's provider context to identify the root cause of the undefined state. 2. Implement the necessary fix, whether it's correcting the initial state or adjusting the selector. 3. Verify the analytics page loads correctly and all charts function as expected.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves debugging a common but potentially tricky Redux issue. The complexity comes from the investigation needed to pinpoint the root cause among several possibilities outlined in the details. Subtasks can follow the logical debugging and implementation flow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Properties API Authentication Issue",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into three subtasks: 1. Review and correct the server-side code to ensure the proper Supabase client (e.g., `createServerComponentClient`) is used with correct cookie/session handling. 2. Inspect and, if necessary, update the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the 'properties' table in Supabase. 3. Test the properties page to confirm data is fetched successfully with a 200 status code.",
			"reasoning": "This task spans the full stack, from Next.js server-side code to Supabase database RLS policies. The complexity lies in coordinating these two layers and debugging potential authentication flow issues, which is more involved than a simple frontend fix."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Correct Settings API 500 Error",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Following the pattern from the properties API fix, create three subtasks: 1. Audit the settings API endpoint to ensure it uses an authenticated server-side Supabase client. 2. Verify the RLS policies on the 'settings' table in Supabase allow read access for admins. 3. Confirm the settings page loads with live data and the API call returns a 200 status.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is lower than the preceding API task because the solution pattern will have already been established by fixing task #3. However, it still requires checking both code and database configuration for a different table."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement 'Create Admin' Button Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into four subtasks: 1. Refactor the modal form to use a proper `onSubmit` handler. 2. Implement the client-side function to call the 'create admin' API endpoint. 3. Add state management to handle the API call's loading and error states, and integrate UI feedback. 4. Perform end-to-end testing, including successful creation and form validation errors.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing a complete client-side feature flow: form handling, an asynchronous API call, state management for loading/error states, and user feedback. It's moderately complex due to the number of interconnected parts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and User Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create four subtasks for implementing error handling: 1. Add `try...catch` blocks, loading state, and toast notifications to the Properties and Settings page data fetching logic. 2. Implement loading state and error feedback for the 'Create Admin' form submission. 3. Review the Analytics and Verification pages to ensure any async operations have user-facing error handling. 4. Manually test all error paths by simulating network failures.",
			"reasoning": "This is a cross-cutting task that requires modifying multiple, distinct features. The complexity comes from the breadth of the changes and the need for consistency, not from a single difficult problem. It is essential for user experience and requires careful implementation across the codebase."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Perform Full Regression Testing with Playwright",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into three sequential subtasks: 1. Execute the full Playwright test suite in a clean staging environment. 2. Analyze the test report, identify all failing tests, and group them by root cause. 3. For each identified root cause, create a new commit to fix the regression and re-run the relevant tests until they pass.",
			"reasoning": "The initial action is simple, but the potential for debugging complex, non-deterministic E2E test failures gives this task moderate complexity. The outcome is uncertain until the tests are run, and fixing regressions can be time-consuming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Final Code Review, Cleanup, and Deployment Preparation",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create four subtasks to serve as a pre-merge checklist: 1. Perform a self-review of all changed files to remove `console.log` statements and other debugging artifacts. 2. Run the linter and formatter to ensure code adheres to the project's style guide. 3. Write a comprehensive Pull Request description summarizing all fixes. 4. Conduct a final smoke test of the fixed features on the staging branch.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-complexity but crucial process step. It requires attention to detail and adherence to team standards rather than complex problem-solving. Subtasks can serve as a quality checklist before merging."
