		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Test Project and Install Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into three subtasks: 1. Create the project directory and initialize npm. 2. Run the Playwright init script and verify its output. 3. Install and configure the `dotenv` package.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational, command-line driven task. The complexity is low as it follows standard, well-documented procedures automated by `npm init playwright`."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Supabase Local Development Environment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks for: 1. Installing the Supabase CLI. 2. Initializing the Supabase project structure. 3. Starting the local services and verifying connection to the database and Studio.",
			"reasoning": "The Supabase CLI simplifies this, but the dependency on a correctly functioning Docker environment introduces a variable that can complicate setup for some users."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Test Data Seeding Script",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into subtasks for designing the seed data structure, scripting the creation of different user roles (customer, agent, admin), scripting the creation of properties and their relations, and a final task for testing the `supabase db reset` flow.",
			"reasoning": "This moves from setup to development. It requires knowledge of the application's data model and SQL to create meaningful and relational test data for multiple user roles."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Playwright for AkwaabaHomes Environment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: 1. Implementing environment variable-driven `baseURL`. 2. Configuring the `projects` array for desktop browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). 3. Adding configurations for mobile device emulation (Pixel 5, iPhone 13).",
			"reasoning": "This is a configuration task. While it requires understanding Playwright's config options, it doesn't involve complex logic. The main work is translating requirements into the config file structure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Page Object Model (POM) Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks for creating the base directory structure, defining a base Page Object class with common methods, and creating the initial Page Objects for the Login, Home, and Property Details pages.",
			"reasoning": "This task sets the architectural foundation for all future UI tests. Doing it well requires forethought and understanding of POM principles to ensure reusability and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "E2E Test: Unauthenticated Property Search and Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this test development into subtasks: 1. Test navigating to the home page and performing a basic location search. 2. Test applying various filters (price, bedrooms). 3. Test asserting the correctness of the search results. 4. Test handling the 'no results found' scenario.",
			"reasoning": "This is a core feature test involving multiple user interactions, handling dynamic results, and writing robust assertions against a list of elements, which is moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "E2E Test: User Registration and Login Flow",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks to test: 1. Successful login for a seeded user. 2. Failed login attempts with incorrect credentials and asserting error messages. 3. The complete new user registration flow.",
			"reasoning": "A fundamental auth flow test. It's a well-understood pattern but requires testing multiple paths (success, wrong password, user not found) and verifying state changes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Reusable Authenticated State",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks: 1. Create the `global-setup.ts` file. 2. Implement logic to programmatically log in and save the storage state for each user role. 3. Configure `playwright.config.ts` to use the global setup. 4. Refactor a test to use the saved storage state.",
			"reasoning": "This is a significant architectural improvement requiring knowledge of advanced Playwright features like `globalSetup` and state management. It has a high impact on the entire suite's performance and reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "E2E Test: Authenticated Customer - Favorites and Saved Searches",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into tests for: 1. A logged-in user adding a property to their favorites. 2. Verifying the favorited property appears on the user's dashboard. 3. Removing the property from favorites and confirming its removal.",
			"reasoning": "This test builds on the authentication setup. It involves user actions that modify backend state and requires verification on different pages, including after reloads to ensure data persistence."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "E2E Test: Agent - Property Listing Creation and Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks for: 1. Testing the creation of a new property listing, including form filling and photo uploads. 2. Verifying the new listing appears on the agent's dashboard. 3. Verifying the new listing is visible in public search results. 4. Testing the flow for editing an existing listing.",
			"reasoning": "This is a major user flow. The complexity comes from automating a long form with various input types and especially the file upload interaction, which can be tricky to stabilize."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "DB Test: Validate Agent Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into: 1. Setting up a database test framework (e.g., Vitest with `pg`). 2. Writing a setup script to create test data. 3. A test where an agent successfully modifies their own property. 4. A test where an agent's attempt to modify another's property is blocked by RLS.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires a different testing paradigm (DB testing, not E2E). It involves managing DB connections and understanding how to impersonate roles in Postgres to test RLS, which is an advanced topic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "E2E Test: Admin - Property Approval and User Moderation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks: 1. Create a programmatic setup hook to create a property pending approval. 2. Test the admin workflow for approving the property. 3. Test the admin workflow for suspending a user account. 4. Verify that a suspended user is unable to log in.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in the multi-actor workflow. The test setup is more involved, requiring programmatic creation of a 'pending' state by one user before another user can perform the action under test."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "DB Test: Validate Admin RLS Policies",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into: 1. Reusing the DB test framework. 2. A test where the admin role successfully modifies a property belonging to an agent. 3. A test where the admin role successfully modifies profile data for a regular customer.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to task 11, this is a specialized form of testing that requires direct database interaction and knowledge of security features like RLS. The technical complexity is high."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Real-time Feature Test with Multiple Browser Contexts",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks: 1. Scaffolding a test that creates two independent browser contexts. 2. Logging in a customer in the first context and an agent in the second. 3. Simulating the customer sending a message. 4. In the agent's context, asserting that a notification appears in real-time.",
			"reasoning": "This is an advanced testing scenario. It requires managing two independent browser sessions, coordinating actions between them, and handling asynchronous updates, making it prone to timing issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Supabase Edge Function Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "For a specific Edge Function, create subtasks to: 1. Test the success path with a valid payload and authentication token. 2. Test the failure path with an invalid payload (400 error). 3. Test the failure path with an invalid auth token (401/403 error). 4. Test any specific business logic edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "This is backend integration testing. It requires knowledge of HTTP clients, JWT for authentication, and testing various API response codes and bodies. It's a different skill set than UI testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Visual Regression Testing",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into: 1. Configuring `toHaveScreenshot` options in `playwright.config.ts`. 2. Adding screenshot assertions to tests for key pages. 3. Running tests with `--update-snapshots` to establish the initial baseline and committing the images.",
			"reasoning": "Playwright makes the technical setup easy. The ongoing complexity is procedural: managing the baseline images, updating them intentionally, and configuring thresholds to avoid flakiness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Accessibility Testing",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks for: 1. Installing `axe-playwright`. 2. Creating a reusable helper function that runs the Axe analysis. 3. Integrating this helper function into the test suite for key pages.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating `axe-playwright` is a well-documented and simple process. The complexity is low from a test-writing perspective; the real work (fixing violations) is a separate development task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Mocking for Third-Party Services",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks to: 1. Identify a test that depends on an external API. 2. Use `page.route` to intercept the API call and return a successful mock response. 3. Add a separate test to mock an API failure and assert the UI handles the error.",
			"reasoning": "This requires understanding Playwright's network interception. Identifying the correct network calls and crafting valid mock responses is moderately complex but greatly improves test stability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Establish Performance Benchmarks",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into: 1. Configuring Playwright tracing. 2. Creating a test that measures Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and asserts it's below a threshold. 3. Creating a similar test for First Contentful Paint (FCP). 4. Documenting the process for analyzing trace files.",
			"reasoning": "This requires using browser-native performance APIs via `page.evaluate`, which can be complex. These tests can also be flaky due to runner performance, requiring careful tuning of thresholds."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Write Basic Security Tests",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks for: 1. An authorization test where a customer attempts to access an admin URL. 2. A reflected XSS test on a search input field. 3. A stored XSS test where a script is entered into a form and asserted to be sanitized on display.",
			"reasoning": "The implementation is straightforward E2E testing. The complexity is in identifying the right vulnerabilities to test for. The described tests are good starting points of medium difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Validate Responsive Design on Mobile",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks to: 1. Execute the core test suites using the 'Mobile Chrome' project. 2. Analyze the report for failures specific to the mobile viewport. 3. Create a separate task to fix each mobile-specific failure.",
			"reasoning": "Running the tests is simple. The complexity comes from debugging and fixing tests that fail only on mobile, which often requires different interaction logic (e.g., opening a hamburger menu)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Verify Cross-Browser Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks: 1. Execute the entire test suite against `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit`. 2. Analyze the report for any tests that fail in only one or two browsers. 3. Create specific tickets to investigate and resolve each cross-browser inconsistency.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to mobile validation, running the tests is trivial. The difficulty is in diagnosing and fixing the rare but frustrating bugs that only appear in one browser engine (often WebKit)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Supabase Backup and Restore Test",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into creating a single shell script that: 1. Dumps the current database. 2. Resets the database. 3. Restores the database from the dump file. 4. Runs validation queries to confirm data integrity.",
			"reasoning": "This is an operational test, likely a shell script orchestrating CLI commands. The complexity comes from scripting a multi-step process involving different tools (`supabase`, `psql`) and ensuring it is robust."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Tests into CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into subtasks for the GitHub Actions workflow: 1. Define the trigger and base job setup. 2. Add steps for checking out code, setting up Node, and caching. 3. Add steps to install the Supabase CLI and run `supabase start`. 4. Add the step to run `npx playwright test`. 5. Add the step to upload the `playwright-report` as a build artifact.",
			"reasoning": "This is a critical piece of infrastructure. It requires knowledge of GitHub Actions syntax, service containers (for Supabase), caching strategies, and artifact management. Debugging CI failures can be difficult."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Test Reporting and Analytics",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create two subtasks: 1. Verify that `reporter: 'html'` is set in `playwright.config.ts`. 2. Write a short document for the team explaining how to use the report and trace viewer from a CI run.",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a configuration and documentation task. Playwright's default HTML reporter is excellent and requires minimal setup. The main effort is ensuring the team knows how to use it."
