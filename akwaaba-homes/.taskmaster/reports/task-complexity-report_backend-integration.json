		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Authentication (Signup & Login)",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Core Authentication (Signup & Login)' into subtasks covering Supabase client setup, Zod schema creation for validation, development of the signup API endpoint with email verification, and development of the login API endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "The task is well-defined and leverages Supabase, which handles much of the heavy lifting (JWT generation, email sending). The complexity lies in the correct integration within the Next.js app structure, setting up API routes, and implementing robust validation. It's a foundational but standard procedure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Session Management, Logout, and Password Reset",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement Session Management, Logout, and Password Reset' into subtasks for creating the logout endpoint, implementing the password reset request endpoint, creating the password update endpoint to handle the reset token, and updating the application middleware to protect routes based on user sessions.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct user flows. The password reset flow is inherently more complex than simple login/logout as it involves out-of-band communication (email) and state management (reset tokens). Updating middleware is a critical security step that requires careful testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Contact Form Backend System",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Develop Contact Form Backend System' task into subtasks for designing and creating the `contacts` table in Supabase, building the Next.js API endpoint to handle form submissions, implementing Zod validation for the contact form data, and setting up the admin notification system using Resend or a Supabase Edge Function.",
			"reasoning": "This is a self-contained feature. Complexity comes from integrating multiple components: database schema design, API route logic, input validation, and a third-party service or edge function for notifications. Each part is relatively straightforward, but together they form a moderately complex task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Profile CRUD and Image Upload",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement User Profile CRUD and Image Upload' task into subtasks for: creating the `profiles` table with a foreign key to `auth.users`, setting up the Supabase Storage bucket with appropriate security policies, developing the API endpoint for profile image uploads, implementing the GET/PUT API endpoints for profile data, and handling profile deletion logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines standard CRUD operations with the more complex functionality of file handling and storage. File uploads introduce challenges like handling multipart form data, security considerations (file type, size), and interacting with a separate service (Supabase Storage). Managing storage bucket policies is a critical security step."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Agent Application Submission System",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Create Agent Application Submission System' task into subtasks for designing and creating the `agent_applications` table in Supabase, developing the protected POST API endpoint for submitting applications, and implementing the Zod validation schema for the application data.",
			"reasoning": "This is a well-defined, single-purpose task. It's essentially a 'create' operation on a new table. The complexity is low because it reuses the existing authentication system for protection and follows a standard pattern of validate-then-insert. It's less complex than the contact form because the notification part is deferred to the admin workflow task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Agent Verification Workflow",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Implement Admin Agent Verification Workflow' task into subtasks for: implementing or updating middleware to enforce 'admin' role-based access, creating the admin-only GET endpoint to list pending applications, building the admin-only PUT endpoint to approve or reject an application, and implementing the logic to update the user's role in the `profiles` table upon approval.",
			"reasoning": "The core complexity here is the introduction of a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, which is a critical security feature. The task involves multiple endpoints and a business process (approval) that triggers state changes across multiple database tables (`agent_applications` and `profiles`), requiring careful logic and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Agent Dashboard Data Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Agent Dashboard Data Endpoints' task into subtasks for creating a protected API route accessible only by users with the 'agent' role, developing the data fetching logic to retrieve agent-specific information (e.g., from `profiles` and `properties` tables), and implementing any necessary data aggregation or transformation to structure the final dashboard payload.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity is centered on data retrieval and aggregation. It requires implementing role-specific access control ('agent' role) and writing potentially complex SQL queries to join and aggregate data from various tables to build the dashboard payload. The data logic can be intricate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Rate Limiting and Audit Logging",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Rate Limiting and Audit Logging' task into subtasks for: selecting and configuring a rate-limiting library and strategy, creating a middleware to apply rate limiting to sensitive endpoints, designing and creating the `audit_logs` table in Supabase, developing a reusable audit logging utility function, and integrating the audit logging function into all critical API endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "This is a cross-cutting concern that affects the entire application architecture. The complexity lies in its system-wide application. Decisions made here (e.g., choosing a Redis-backed rate limiter) have infrastructure implications, and instrumenting numerous endpoints for auditing requires a robust and well-designed utility."
