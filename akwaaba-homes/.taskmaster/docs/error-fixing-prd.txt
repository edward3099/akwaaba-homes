# AkwaabaHomes Critical Error Resolution PRD

## Project Overview
AkwaabaHomes is a real estate marketplace for Ghana with a focus on diaspora buyers. The project has 35+ critical errors that must be resolved to make it production-ready.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors (86 Total)
- Property access errors in PropertyDetail component
- Missing type exports (SortOption, CurrencyCode, CurrencyRate)
- UI component type mismatches in AuthErrorDisplay and FormField
- Authentication state type conflicts
- Form validation errors with ZodError
- API client type issues with spread operations
- Hook integration errors across multiple files
- Service and utility type mismatches

### 2. Missing Configuration
- No .env.local file despite extensive environment variable usage
- Missing API route files (deleted propertyId routes)
- Inconsistent port configuration

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- Missing admin role checks in API routes
- Rate limiting middleware errors
- Authentication flow type conflicts

### 4. Performance & Code Quality Issues
- 101+ console.log statements in production code
- 67+ uses of any/unknown types
- Missing error boundaries
- Incomplete TODO items in production code

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Setup
- Create .env.local with proper Supabase configuration
- Fix port consistency issues
- Resolve webpack cache errors

### TypeScript Resolution
- Fix all 86 TypeScript compilation errors
- Implement proper type definitions
- Remove any/unknown type usage where possible
- Add missing type exports

### Authentication System

- Resolve authentication hook errors
- Implement proper error handling
- Fix admin role verification

### API & Services
- Restore deleted API route files
- Fix API client type issues
- Resolve service export problems
- Fix image optimization service types

### UI Components
- Fix component type mismatches
- Resolve form field validation issues
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Fix toast integration errors

### Performance & Security
- Remove console.log statements from production
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Add missing admin role checks
- Fix middleware type issues

## Success Criteria
- All TypeScript errors resolved (0 compilation errors)
- Application builds successfully
- All API routes functional
- Authentication system working
- No console errors in production
- All security vulnerabilities addressed
- Performance optimized

## Implementation Approach
- Use Context7 for each error resolution
- Fix errors in order of criticality (build-breaking first)
- Test each fix before proceeding
- Maintain existing functionality while fixing errors
- Document all changes made

## Priority Order
1. Critical build-breaking errors (TypeScript compilation)
2. Missing configuration files
3. Authentication system fixes
4. API route restoration
5. Security vulnerability fixes
6. Performance and code quality improvements

## Tools & Technologies
- Context7 for error resolution guidance
- TypeScript for type safety
- Next.js 15 for framework
- Supabase for backend
- TailwindCSS for styling
- ShadCN UI for components
