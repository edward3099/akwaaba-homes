# Backend Integration PRD - AkwaabaHomes

## Project Overview
Implement missing backend logic to complete frontend-backend integration for AkwaabaHomes real estate platform. This includes authentication system, contact forms, agent management, and user profile systems.

## Current State Analysis
- Frontend is fully implemented with authentication pages, contact forms, and agent dashboard
- Backend has excellent property management, admin, and seller systems
- Critical gaps exist in authentication, contact handling, and agent verification workflows
- Integration score is currently 6.5/10 due to missing core user management systems

## Objectives
1. Complete the authentication system (login, signup, logout, password reset)
2. Implement contact form backend with storage and notification
3. Create agent application and verification system
4. Add user profile management capabilities
5. Achieve 9.5/10 integration score

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Authentication System
- Implement Supabase Auth integration
- Create login endpoint with JWT token generation
- Implement secure signup with email verification
- Add password reset functionality
- Create logout and session management
- Implement role-based access control (agent, admin, seller)

### 2. Contact Form System
- Create contact form API endpoint
- Implement form validation and sanitization
- Add contact storage in database
- Create notification system for new contacts
- Add admin dashboard for contact management

### 3. Agent Management System
- Implement agent application submission
- Create agent verification workflow
- Add agent profile management
- Implement agent dashboard data endpoints
- Create admin approval system

### 4. User Profile System
- Implement user profile CRUD operations
- Add profile image upload functionality
- Create user preferences and settings
- Implement profile verification system

### 5. Security & Validation
- Ensure all endpoints have proper authentication
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Create audit logging for user actions

## Technology Stack
- Next.js 14 API routes
- Supabase for database and authentication
- Zod for schema validation
- TypeScript for type safety
- Existing middleware for authentication

## Success Criteria
- All frontend authentication flows work end-to-end
- Contact forms successfully submit and store data
- Agent application and verification workflow is complete
- User profiles can be created, updated, and managed
- Integration score reaches 9.5/10
- All endpoints have proper error handling and validation

## Dependencies
- Existing Supabase database schema
- Current authentication middleware
- Frontend components already implemented
- Existing security and validation patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- Use Context7 for research on best practices at each stage
- Implement incrementally with thorough testing
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems
