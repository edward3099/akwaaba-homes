# Admin Dashboard Critical Issues Fix - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Fix all critical issues discovered during comprehensive Playwright MCP testing of the AkwaabaHomes admin dashboard. The admin dashboard is currently 97% functional but has several critical runtime errors and non-functional buttons that prevent proper administration functionality.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Pending Verifications Page Runtime Error
**Problem**: "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" error on `/admin/verifications`
**Impact**: Completely blocks access to verification management
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### 2. Property Approvals Page Runtime Error  
**Problem**: Same "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" error on `/admin/properties/approvals`
**Impact**: Completely blocks access to property approval management
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### 3. Analytics Page Runtime Error
**Problem**: "Cannot destructure property 'activeIndex' of useAppSelector" error on `/admin/analytics`
**Impact**: Analytics dashboard cannot be used due to client-side JavaScript error
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### 4. Create Admin Button Non-Functional
**Problem**: "Create Admin" button in modal doesn't close modal or create admin account
**Impact**: Prevents creating new admin accounts
**Priority**: HIGH

### 5. Properties API Authentication Issue
**Problem**: 500 Internal Server Error when fetching properties due to authentication issues
**Impact**: Properties page shows "Failed to fetch properties" error
**Priority**: HIGH

### 6. Settings API Error
**Problem**: 500 Internal Server Error when fetching settings data
**Impact**: Settings page loads with mock data instead of real configuration
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Fixes
- Fix React component prop passing issues in verifications and approvals pages
- Resolve useAppSelector destructuring error in analytics component
- Fix form submission logic in admin creation modal
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

### Backend Fixes  
- Resolve authentication issues in properties API endpoint
- Fix settings API endpoint errors
- Ensure proper Supabase RLS policies and authentication flow
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Testing Requirements
- All buttons must produce expected outcomes
- No runtime errors on any admin pages
- Proper navigation between all admin sections
- Form submissions work correctly
- API endpoints return proper responses

## Success Criteria
- All admin dashboard buttons functional and produce expected outcomes
- No runtime errors on any admin pages
- Properties page loads and displays data correctly
- Admin creation modal works properly
- Settings page loads real configuration data
- All navigation between admin sections works seamlessly

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS)
- Testing: Playwright MCP for end-to-end validation
- Research: Context7 for best practices and solutions

## Implementation Approach
1. Research each issue using Context7 to understand best practices
2. Fix frontend component issues (React props, state management)
3. Fix backend API authentication and data fetching issues
4. Test all fixes using Playwright MCP
5. Validate that all buttons produce expected outcomes
6. Ensure no runtime errors remain

## Dependencies
- Supabase MCP for backend operations
- Context7 for research and best practices
- Playwright MCP for testing validation
