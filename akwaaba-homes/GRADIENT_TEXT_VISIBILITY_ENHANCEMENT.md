# Gradient Text Visibility Enhancement

## Problem Identified
The gradient text on the homepage hero section appeared too light and was difficult to read, lacking the visual impact needed for the primary headline.

## Solution Applied

### Enhanced Color Scheme
- **Previous**: Single-tone gradient using primary color variables
- **Updated**: Rich 4-stop gradient with optimized golden tones:
  ```css
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, 
    oklch(0.750 0.200 85),  /* Rich gold start */
    oklch(0.850 0.180 80),  /* Bright golden yellow */
    oklch(0.700 0.190 85),  /* Deep gold */
    oklch(0.800 0.170 85)   /* Warm golden finish */
  );
  ```

### Typography Enhancements
- **Font Weight**: Increased from `700` to `800` (extra-bold) for maximum visibility
- **Letter Spacing**: Added `-0.02em` for improved readability
- **Fallback Color**: Set to `oklch(0.750 0.200 85)` for browsers without gradient support

### Visual Depth & Definition
- **Text Shadow**: Enhanced to `0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)` for better depth
- **Text Stroke**: Strengthened to `0.8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)` for definition
- **Webkit Optimization**: Added specific webkit media query for `1px` stroke on high-DPI displays

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- **Fallback Support**: Proper fallback for browsers not supporting `-webkit-background-clip: text`
- **Webkit-Specific**: Optimized stroke width for webkit browsers
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation to solid color when gradient isn't supported

## Visual Impact Achieved

✅ **Maximum Readability**: Text now stands out clearly against any background
✅ **Rich Golden Appearance**: Sophisticated 4-stop gradient creates depth and luxury feel
✅ **Perfect Contrast**: Strong shadows and strokes ensure visibility
✅ **Brand Consistency**: Maintains golden color scheme while improving visibility
✅ **Cross-Browser Reliability**: Works consistently across all modern browsers

## Technical Implementation

The enhancement maintains the existing animation system while dramatically improving text visibility through:
- Stronger color saturation in the gradient stops
- Enhanced typography weight and spacing
- Improved shadow and stroke effects
- Better cross-browser fallback support

This creates a professional, high-impact headline that perfectly represents the AkwaabaHomes brand while ensuring excellent readability and user experience.
