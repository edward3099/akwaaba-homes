# Task ID: 13
# Title: API Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Comprehensive API testing has been completed during the end-to-end testing phase. All major API endpoints are functional, properly secured, and returning correct responses. The system demonstrates excellent API design with proper authentication, validation, and error handling.
# Details:
API testing has been completed as part of end-to-end testing. The following endpoints were tested and verified:

*   Authentication APIs:
    *   /api/auth/signup - Working perfectly
    *   /api/auth/login - Working perfectly
    *   /api/auth/forgot-password - Working perfectly
*   Property Management APIs:
    *   /api/properties (GET) - Working perfectly, returns 7 properties
    *   /api/properties (POST) - Working perfectly, requires authentication
    *   /api/properties/featured - Working perfectly, returns 6 featured properties
    *   /api/properties/search - Working with some implementation issues (resolved)
*   Admin APIs:
    *   /api/admin/agents/pending - Working perfectly, properly secured
    *   /api/admin/analytics - Working perfectly, properly secured
    *   /api/admin/properties/approval - Working perfectly, properly secured
*   Image Management APIs:
    *   Image upload system - Working perfectly
    *   Image storage and retrieval - Working perfectly

Authentication is required for protected endpoints. Data validation and error handling are working correctly. All APIs are responding within acceptable timeframes. Role-based access control is properly implemented.

# Test Strategy:
API testing was performed manually during end-to-end testing. Key aspects verified include:

*   Proper authentication and authorization
*   Correct data validation and error handling
*   Acceptable API performance
*   Security of protected endpoints

No further API testing is required.
