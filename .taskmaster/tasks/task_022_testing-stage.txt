# Description: Test form state persistence and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
# Details:
1.  Use local storage or session storage to persist form state.
2.  Implement error handling to display error messages to the user.
3.  Verify that form state is persisted correctly and that error messages are displayed correctly.
4.  Use `react-hook-form` for form state management.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Write unit tests for form state persistence and error handling.
2.  Manually test form state persistence and error handling with different inputs and scenarios.
3.  Use automated testing tools like Cypress to verify form state persistence and error handling.
