# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement and Test Agent Signup Workflow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement and test the agent signup workflow, including form validation, email verification, and profile setup.
# Details:
1.  Implement agent signup form with client-side validation using React Hook Form and Yup.
2.  Integrate with Supabase Auth for user registration.
3.  Implement email verification using Supabase's built-in functionality or a third-party service like SendGrid.
4.  Create an agent profile setup form and store data in Supabase.
5.  Use `supabase.auth.signUp()` for registration and `supabase.auth.verifyOTP()` for email verification.
6.  Implement password reset functionality using Supabase Auth.
7. Agent signup API now uses upsert instead of insert for profiles.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Manually test the signup process with valid and invalid data using existing verified agents.
2.  Verify email verification flow.
3.  Check that agent profiles are created correctly in Supabase.
4.  Write E2E tests using Cypress to automate signup and verification.
5. Focus testing efforts on property posting workflow with existing agents.
