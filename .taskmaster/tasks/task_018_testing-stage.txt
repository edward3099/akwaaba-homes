# Task ID: 18
# Title: Accessibility Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure screen reader and keyboard navigation support for accessibility. Address critical accessibility issues identified by ESLint.
# Details:
1.  Use a screen reader like NVDA or VoiceOver to test accessibility.
2.  Verify that all UI elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
3.  Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
4.  Use `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to enforce accessibility best practices in React components.  Address issues identified by the linter, including missing alt text, form label associations, keyboard navigation for interactive elements, heading content, and non-interactive element interactions.

ESLint accessibility rules are now properly configured and working. Test files no longer have missing alt text issues. Form labels are properly associated with their controls. Interactive elements now have proper keyboard event handlers. Backdrop/overlay elements have proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support. Remaining issues include multiple form label association issues across several components (CreatePropertyForm, PropertyListingForm, etc.), some missing alt text in image components, and interactive element accessibility issues in some components.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Manually test accessibility using a screen reader and keyboard navigation.
2.  Use automated testing tools like Axe to detect accessibility issues.
3.  Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
4.  Retest with screen readers and keyboard navigation after addressing ESLint identified issues.
5.  Run final accessibility audit.
