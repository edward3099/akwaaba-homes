# Task ID: 20
# Title: Form Validation Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Test client-side and server-side form validation to ensure data integrity.
# Details:
1.  Implement client-side form validation using React Hook Form and Yup.
2.  Implement server-side form validation using Supabase functions or a Node.js API.
3.  Verify that form validation prevents invalid data from being submitted.
4.  Use `yup` for schema validation.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Write unit tests for form validation functions.
2.  Manually test form validation with different inputs and scenarios.
3.  Use automated testing tools like Cypress to verify form validation.

# Subtasks:
