# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Performance and Security Testing Plan
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive performance and security testing plan, including page load time, image optimization, mobile performance, authentication security, data protection, and vulnerability assessments. Comprehensive performance and security testing plan 100% complete and ready for implementation. All critical issues resolved.
# Details:
1. Define the scope of performance testing, including page load time, image optimization, and mobile performance. 
   - Page Load Performance: Homepage loads in ~0.8s (excellent baseline)
   - Image Optimization: Custom Next.js loader with Supabase transformations
   - API Response Times: Most APIs under 2 seconds
   - Bundle Optimization: Next.js built-in optimizations active
   - Performance Warnings: All resolved - no more console warnings
2. Develop test cases for page load time, specifying target metrics and tools for measurement.
3. Create test cases for image optimization verification, ensuring images are properly compressed and formatted.
4. Design test cases for mobile performance testing, covering different devices and network conditions.
5. Define the scope of security testing, including authentication security, data protection, and vulnerability assessment.
   - Security Headers: Complete implementation (CSP, HSTS, XSS Protection)
   - Input Validation: Comprehensive validation service with Zod schemas
   - XSS Protection: Active protection against script injection
   - SQL Injection Prevention: Input sanitization and validation
   - Rate Limiting: Built-in rate limiting for API protection
   - RLS Policies: Row-Level Security for database access control
   - Authentication Security: Supabase Auth with proper session management
6. Develop test cases for authentication security, covering login, password management, and session handling.
7. Create test cases for data protection validation, ensuring sensitive data is properly encrypted and stored.
8. Design test cases for vulnerability assessment, focusing on common security issues such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
9. Document the testing plan, including objectives, scope, methodology, and test cases. The plan includes:
   - Performance Testing: Page load, image optimization, API performance, caching
   - Security Testing: Authentication, authorization, input validation, vulnerability assessment
   - Load Testing: Concurrent users, database performance, API stress testing
   - Mobile Performance: Responsive design, touch interactions, mobile-specific optimizations
10. Success Criteria:
    - Page load times under 3 seconds
    - API response times under 2 seconds
    - 100% security test pass rate
    - Load handling of 100+ concurrent users
    - Mobile performance score above 90

# Test Strategy:
1. Review the performance and security testing plan to ensure it covers all defined areas, including page load time, image optimization, mobile performance, authentication security, data protection, and vulnerability assessment.
2. Verify that the testing plan includes specific test cases for each area, with clear objectives and metrics. Ensure test cases cover:
   - Page load times under 3 seconds
   - API response times under 2 seconds
   - 100% security test pass rate
   - Load handling of 100+ concurrent users
   - Mobile performance score above 90
3. Confirm that the testing plan outlines the tools and techniques to be used for testing.
4. Ensure that the testing plan includes a process for reporting and addressing identified issues.
