# Task ID: 14
# Title: Database Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Validate data persistence and relationships in the Supabase database. Comprehensive validation was performed during end-to-end testing.
# Details:
1.  Write SQL queries to verify that data is stored correctly in the Supabase database.
2.  Verify that relationships between tables are correctly defined and enforced.
3.  Test data integrity by updating and deleting data and verifying that the changes are reflected in the database.
4.  Use Supabase's built-in data validation features to ensure data integrity.

**Completed during end-to-end testing:**
- Data persistence verification for users, properties, agent profiles, and images.
- Table relationships validation for Users ↔ Profiles, Properties ↔ Users (seller), Properties ↔ Property Images, and Agent Applications ↔ Users.
- Data integrity testing including updates, deletions, foreign key constraints, and unique constraints.
- Supabase features validation including Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, real-time subscriptions, database triggers, and functions (handle_new_user).

# Test Strategy:
1.  Write integration tests to verify data persistence and relationships.
2.  Use SQL queries to manually verify data integrity.
3.  Monitor database performance using Supabase's built-in monitoring tools.

**Completed during end-to-end testing:**
- Verified database statistics including total tables, properties, users, agents, and pending properties.
