The `handle_new_user()` function automatically creates a profile record when a new user is created, but it's looking for different metadata fields than what our signup API provides.\n\n### Root Cause:\n1. **Metadata Mismatch**: The trigger expects `full_name` but our API sends `first_name` + `last_name`\n2. **Role Conflict**: The trigger sets `user_role` to `'seller'` by default, but we want `'agent'`\n3. **Duplicate Insert**: The trigger creates a profile, then our API tries to create another one, causing conflicts\n\n### Current Function Behavior:\n```sql\n-- The trigger function is looking for:\nCOALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name')\n-- But we're sending:\n\"first_name\": \"Test\", \"last_name\": \"Agent3\"\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Fix the metadata field names in the signup API to match what the trigger expects\n- Or modify the trigger function to handle our current metadata structure\n- Test the signup process again after fixing the conflict\n</info added on 2025-08-26T21:42:18.794Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-26T21:44:16.139Z>\n## Agent Signup Testing - Persistent Email Validation Issue\n\n### Issue Found:\nThe agent signup is consistently failing with the error \"Email address is invalid\" from Supabase Auth, even with completely new email addresses.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis:\n1. **Database Trigger Issue Resolved**: Fixed the `handle_new_user()` function schema reference issue\n2. **New Issue Identified**: Supabase Auth is rejecting all email addresses with \"Email address is invalid\" error\n3. **Not Duplicate Email Issue**: Error occurs even with completely new, unused email addresses\n4. **Supabase Configuration Issue**: The error is coming from Supabase Auth itself, not from our validation logic\n\n### Current Status:\n- Database trigger function is now working correctly\n- Signup API is properly formatted and sending correct data\n- Supabase Auth is rejecting all email addresses for unknown reasons\n- Need to investigate Supabase project configuration\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Investigate Supabase project settings and email validation rules\n- Check if there are any email domain restrictions\n- Test with different email formats and domains\n- Move on to test other aspects of the system while this issue is investigated\n</info added on 2025-08-26T21:44:16.139Z>",

Check if the verification and approval pages exist\n2. Examine the button click handlers and API endpoints\n3. Implement missing API endpoints for approve/reject actions\n4. Add proper confirmation dialogs and success/error handling\n\nThe buttons appear to be navigation-only at this point, lacking the actual business logic for approvals and rejections.\n</info added on 2025-08-28T17:34:42.363Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-28T18:08:28.346Z>\nSuccessfully implemented the backend logic for Action Buttons:\n\n**API Endpoints Created**:\n1. **`/api/admin/verifications`**: Handles agent and property verifications with GET (list) and POST (approve/reject) methods\n2. **`/api/admin/properties/approvals`**: Handles property approvals with GET (list) and POST (approve/reject) methods\n\n**Frontend Updates**:\n1. **Verifications Page**: Updated to use real API data instead of mock data, with working approve/reject functionality\n2. **Action Button Handlers**: Implemented `handleApprove` and `handleReject` functions that call the appropriate API endpoints\n3. **State Management**: Added React state for verifications data, loading states, and error handling\n4. **Real-time Updates**: The page now refreshes data after approve/reject actions\n\n**Functionality Implemented**:\n- **Approve Button**: Updates verification status to 'verified' (agents) or 'active' (properties) in the database\n- **Reject Button**: Updates verification status to 'rejected' with optional reason input\n- **Review Button**: Placeholder for future detailed review functionality\n- **Data Fetching**: Real-time data from Supabase with proper authentication checks\n\n**Database Updates**:\n- Agent verifications: Updates `verification_status` in profiles table\n- Property verifications: Updates `status` in properties table\n- Both include admin review metadata (reviewer, timestamp, notes)\n\nThe action buttons now perform their intended functions and persist changes to the database, resolving the issue where buttons only highlighted without performing actions.\n</info added on 2025-08-28T18:08:28.346Z>",

Based on previous testing, some admin dashboard navigation buttons show correct URLs but content switching is incomplete or broken.\n\n**Current Status**:\n1. **Overview Button**: Working correctly - shows admin overview content\n2. **User Management Button**: Navigates to `/admin/users` but shows authentication error toasts\n3. **Properties Button**: Navigates to `/admin/properties` but shows \"Error Loading Properties\"\n4. **Analytics Button**: Navigates to `/admin/analytics` but shows client-side exception\n5. **Monitoring Button**: Working correctly - shows monitoring content\n6. **Settings Button**: Working correctly - shows settings content\n\n**Issues Identified**:\n- User Management and Properties pages have authentication issues (likely related to the API fixes we just implemented)\n- Analytics page has client-side exceptions (partially fixed with dynamic imports)\n- Content switching appears to be working for most buttons, but the content itself has errors\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1.
