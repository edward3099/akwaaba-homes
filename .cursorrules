# AkwaabaHomes - Project Intelligence & Patterns

## Project Overview
AkwaabaHomes is a real estate marketplace for Ghana with a focus on diaspora buyers. The project is 97% complete with a solid frontend foundation and fully integrated Supabase backend.

## Critical Implementation Paths

### 1. Ghana Cultural Integration
- **Color System**: Always use Ghana flag colors (red: #C21807, gold: #FFD700, green: #00A86B)
- **Language**: Use "Akwaaba" (Welcome) throughout the platform
- **Local Context**: Integrate Plus codes, mobile money, WhatsApp for Ghana market
- **Currency**: Store all prices in GHS, convert for display

### 2. Diaspora-First Architecture
- **Multi-Currency Display**: Real-time conversion for international buyers
- **Inspection Scheduling**: Support self, family, and representative modes
- **Trust Building**: Mandatory geo-tagging, seller verification, document validation
- **Communication**: WhatsApp primary, phone secondary, email tertiary

### 3. Component Patterns
- **Mobile-First**: All components must work on mobile devices first
- **Ghana Theme**: Use custom utility classes for Ghana-specific styling
- **ShadCN UI**: Leverage existing component library with custom variants
- **TypeScript Strict**: Maintain comprehensive type safety throughout

## User Preferences & Workflow

### Development Approach
- **Frontend-First**: Build excellent UI/UX before backend integration
- **Component-Based**: Create reusable, tested components
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strict mode for all new code
- **Mobile Testing**: Regularly test across device sizes

### Code Quality Standards
- **ESLint**: Follow established linting rules
- **Component Organization**: Group by feature in components/ directory
- **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Documentation**: Update memory bank after significant changes

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Property Data Structure
```typescript
// Always use this structure for properties
interface Property {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  price: number; // Always in GHS
  currency: 'GHS'; // Enforced at type level
  location: {
    coordinates: [number, number]; // Mandatory geo-tagging
    plusCode?: string;
    address: string;
  };
  verification: {
    geoTagged: boolean;
    documentsVerified: boolean;
    sellerVerified: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Search & Filter Patterns
- **URL State**: Keep search filters in URL params for shareable links
- **Advanced Filters**: Sidebar layout on desktop, modal on mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **Pagination**: Intelligent page numbering with mobile optimization

### Trust & Safety Implementation
- **Verification Badges**: Green shield (verified), blue check (phone), gold star (premium)
- **Document Upload**: Admin review workflow for all property documents
- **Duplicate Detection**: Algorithm + manual review system
- **Community Reporting**: Fraud flagging with admin monitoring

## Known Challenges & Solutions

### Performance Optimization
- **Image Loading**: Use Next.js Image with proper sizing for Ghana's 3G networks
- **Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking and dynamic imports for large components
- **Mobile Performance**: Target <3s load time on 3G networks
- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase RLS**: All database operations must respect row-level security
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for all public endpoints
- **Real-time Features**: Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Development Tools
- **Next.js 15**: Use App Router with file-based routing
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Latest version with custom Ghana theme
- **ShadCN UI**: Base components with custom variants
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode for all new code

### Testing Strategy
- **Component Testing**: Test all components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Test API endpoints with proper auth
- **E2E Testing**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution
- **Started**: Simple frontend demo
- **Evolved**: Full-stack application with Supabase
- **Current**: Production-ready with comprehensive testing
- **Next**: Performance optimization and monitoring

### Technology Choices
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 for modern React development
- **Backend**: Supabase for rapid development and scalability
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for utility-first approach
- **State**: Zustand for lightweight state management

## Critical Success Factors

### User Experience
- **Diaspora Journey**: Seamless experience for international buyers
- **Local Market**: WhatsApp integration and mobile money preparation
- **Trust Building**: Prominent verification indicators
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interactions and smooth scrolling

### Technical Excellence
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Security**: RLS policies, rate limiting, input validation
- **Performance**: Optimized for Ghana's network conditions
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## Development Workflow

### Session Start
1. **Read Memory Bank**: Review all memory bank files for context
2. **Check Current Status**: Understand what's completed and what's next
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep memory bank current with changes
4. **Follow Patterns**: Apply established patterns for consistency

### Implementation Process
1. **Plan**: Understand requirements and create implementation plan
2. **Build**: Follow established component and styling patterns
3. **Test**: Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility
4. **Document**: Update memory bank with new patterns or decisions

### Quality Assurance
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors
- **ESLint**: Follow established code quality rules
- **Mobile Testing**: Test across device sizes
- **Performance**: Monitor load times and Core Web Vitals
